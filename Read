I individually tested both the synth.py and django implementation, they were working properly


I have linked both the codes but somethings ar still to be done:
	
	in views.py check line 4,5 .. we need to import both of them in the same way as I have used the name of functions and global variables..comment out the lines 39,40,66,67 and uncomment 43-63(these lines link both the codes)

	in input_specs.py check line 1 ..After this just uncomment line 22 and comment line 23,21

	 django is implemented in python3 but there should be very little problem as I found on internet .. check it once.. 

	Now the code should work fine..


Summary of the changes done in their code:
	
	synth.py:
		used main function and a variable 'correct'
		added lines 21,22,23 
	
	input_specs.py:
		added two functions(last two)
		declared accept(reject)_strings globally

	added a new file test.py

At present both the codes are working(in input_specs.py x5 should be 'S' for grammar to be correct)
